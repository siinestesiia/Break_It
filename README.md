# Break It! 

This is a 3D *Breakout* (1976) / *Arkanoid* (1986) style of game set in space.

## Implemented Features
* The *Ball* launches when the player press Spacebar key.
* The *Ball* bounces every surface it collides and reflects it direction (reflection vector).
* If the *Ball* collides with a brick, it will subtract 1 point from its hitpoints, if it reaches 0, the the brick will be destroyed and the Player gain some points.
* If the *Ball* exits the playzone 3 times, it's *game over* (for now it's just a message).
* If the *Player* destroys all bricks within a level, then the next level is loaded.
* Depending on the amount of hitpoints a *Brick* has, it changes color.

## Desired Features
*  To have at least 10 different levels.
*  To have a **main menu** for quitting or starting the game.
*  To have a **pause menu** for quitting or continuing the game.
*  To have a **game over** screen where you can select whether to replay the level, start over the game or simply quit the game.
